# RestInCode (RIC)

A memorial site for Hackers and Infosec people who have passed


Note: I currently don't have the time to finish this idea up, but I would love to have sort of a wikipedia style page for each of those amazing members of our community that have passed away. Links to their research, social media accounts, obituarys, etc. I would also like to have the twitter account I created (@RestInCode) to tweet out via Lamda or whatever a reminder of dates of passing or other messages of well wishes on a regular basis.

If you would like to work on this or help create it before I have time to please do. I would love the help. Either shoot a pull request, make an issue or contact me directly and lets get this going.
