# RestInCode (RIC)

## A memorial site for Hackers and InfoSec people who have passed.

Note: I currently don't have the time to finish this idea up, but I would love to have sort of a wikipedia style page for each of those amazing members of our community that have passed away. Links to their research, social media accounts, obituary, stories that highlight their qualities, etc. I would also like to have the Twitter account I created [@RestInCode](https://twitter.com/RestInCode) to tweet out via Lamda or whatever a reminder of dates of passing or other messages of well wishes on a regular basis.

Note 2: The idea is this is a central, neutral memorial for _all_. All submitted for memorial are welcome.

If you would like to work on this or help create it before I have time to please do. I would love the help. Either shoot a pull request, make an issue or contact me directly and lets get this going.

P.S This is definitely not a "mubix" project, so if there is a better home for this repo or site, I'm totally open to doing that, just want to make it somewhere we can learn about those we have lost and the incredible works they did.
